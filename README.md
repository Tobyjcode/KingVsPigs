# 👑 Kings and Pigs

Hey! I’m **ColaDrinker**, and this is **Kings and Pigs** a fast-paced little platformer where you play as a grumpy King on a mission to bash through pig-infested levels.  
Collect diamonds, squash enemies, and try to beat the clock for the best score you can.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

The goal is simple: reach the end of each level, grab as many diamonds as you can, take out enemies, and finish as quickly as possible.

### Controls

- **Move:** Arrow keys or A/D  
- **Jump:** Space or W / Up arrow  
- **Attack:** (Fill in your key, e.g. J or Ctrl)  
- **Sprint / Interact / Restart:** (Add keys if your game uses them)

Once you reach the door at the end, you'll move on to the next level.
